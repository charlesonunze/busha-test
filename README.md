# Busha Backend Challenge

Build a RESTful API that satisfies these [requirements](https://www.notion.so/Busha-Backend-Engineering-Task-Golang-1667d4c4d01f4737a907889502c7c6be).

## Installation

To get the code running locally, clone the repo. Make sure you have Golang, Redis and Postgres installed and running.

Alternatively you can run the project without installing any of that by running:

```bash
  docker-compose up --build
```

You might wanna install Docker to do that though.
